# hw-3-hangman
This is my attempt at a hang man game. The game has set number of words it picks from and uses Jquery and javascript to allow players to guess letters and see if they can firgure out the word before they run out of guesses. I used a fair share of google to create parts and look at how other people made games like this. This game also has reset button i called quit.

This source helped me the most it helped me wrap my head around how to create basic elements of the game that i thought would be very diffcult. I also looked at w3scools.com to help me understand basics of jQuery.
