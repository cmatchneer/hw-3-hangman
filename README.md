# hw-3-hangman
This is my attempt at a hang man game. The game has set number of words it picks from and uses Jquery and javascript to allow players to guess letters and see if they can firgure out the word before they run out of guesses. I used a fair share of google to create parts and look at how other people made games like this. This game also has reset button i called quit.

This source helped me the most it helped me wrap my head around how to create basic elements of the game that i thought would be very diffcult. I also looked at w3scools.com to help me understand basics of jQuery. I am the sole creator of this game from the function to the style. This game stores the words in array and uses a random number generator to select each word. The tips are stored in a object and game starts when the user presses a letter to start guessing. When it ends it keeps track of wins and losses as well.
